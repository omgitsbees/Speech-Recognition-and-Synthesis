Speech Recognition and Synthesis

This Python project utilizes speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries to recognize speech from a microphone input and synthesize it back as spoken output. The application continuously listens for speech, recognizes the spoken words, and converts them into speech using text-to-speech synthesis.
Features

    Speech Recognition: Uses Google's speech recognition API to transcribe spoken words into text.
    Speech Synthesis: Converts recognized text into speech output using pyttsx3.
    Continuous Listening: Continuously listens for speech and responds with synthesized audio.

Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

    speech_recognition: For recognizing spoken words from the microphone.
    pyttsx3: For converting text to speech.

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

bash

pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3

Additionally, you will need to have a working microphone connected to your system.
How It Works

    The program prompts the user to speak into the microphone.
    The speech is captured and processed using Google's speech recognition service.
    If the speech is successfully recognized, the recognized text is displayed and spoken back to the user using a text-to-speech engine.
    If speech is not recognized, an error message is displayed, and the program continues listening for further input.

Usage

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-recognition-synthesis.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd speech-recognition-synthesis

    Run the script:

bash

python speech_recognition_synthesis.py

    Speak into your microphone when prompted, and the program will recognize and respond to your speech.

Example

yaml

Please say something:
You said: Hello world

Limitations

    The program relies on the Google Speech API, which requires an internet connection for speech recognition.
    Speech recognition may not work well in noisy environments.
